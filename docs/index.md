!![Painkiller](../img/index/pk02.jpg "Heaven's Got a Hitman")

Painkiller is a first-person shooter video game developed by Polish game studio People Can Fly and published by DreamCatcher Interactive in April 2004.

It was the first game based on PainEngine.<br>
Apparently this engine used some modified pieces of Quake code and included some proprietory tools like:
Havok (for physics), Miles Engine (for sound), Xtreme Toolkit (for exe).<br>
NecroEngine is a continuation of PainEngine that was significantly improved.<br>
The engine seems to have been deprecated after 2010.

Some history on the Painkiller development was told by the former People Can Fly employees that founded The Astronauts game company. The article can be found [here](https://www.theastronauts.com/2014/08/ten-things-didnt-know-painkiller/).
