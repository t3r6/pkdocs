# This site contains information regading PC games based on PainEngine/NecroEngine

The first game that used PainEngine was Painkiller 2004.<br>
Apparently this engine used some modified pieces of Quake code and included some proprietory tools like:
Havok (for physics), Miles Engine (for sound), Xtreme Toolkit (for exe).<br>
NecroEngine is a continuation of PainEngine that was significantly improved.<br>
The engine seems to have been deprecated after 2010.
