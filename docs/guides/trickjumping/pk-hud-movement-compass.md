# Painkiller HUD movement compass

> This mod is made by XDavidXtreme.

This mod allows you to track pressed buttons in the game (Quake 3 Defrag style). It is very useful for trickjump movies.

Copy the **HUD.lua** file to `..\Painkiller\Data\LScripts\HUD\`. Create folders if required.

Type in `/setmaxfps 125` in the game console to play with consistent physics.

It is recommended to enable `/speedmeter 1` via the in-game console to track your speed.

[**HUD.lua**](https://github.com/t3r6/painkiller-lscripts-mods/blob/david-movement-keys/LScripts/HUD/HUD.lua) for original Painkiller 1.64.

[**HUD.lua**](https://github.com/t3r6/painkiller-plusplus-1.3-decompiled/blob/david-pressed-keys/LScripts/HUD/HUD.lua) for PK++ 1.3.
