# Painkiller Autohop

> This script is made by XDavidXtreme.

You can use this code to enable the autohop (auto bhop / auto bunny hop / auto jump) feature in Painkiller. It works the same as in Xonotic, Warsow, Warfork.

Autohop is tied to a jump action (`Space` by default) so it will even work if you bind `Jump` to another key.

Copy the [**file**](https://github.com/t3r6/pkdocs/blob/main/code/david/Classes/CPlayer.lua) to `..\Painkiller\Data\LScripts\Classes\`. Create folders if required.
