# Painkiller Command Line Options

The information was taken from [pkeuro](https://www.pkeuro.net/?p=249).

```
+connect [xx.xx.xx.xx>]
+playrecording [demo name]
+dedicatedserver
+private
+name [player name]
+map [map name]
+interface [xx.xx.xx.xx]
+speed [0,1,2,3]
+port [xxxx]
+maxfps [xx]
+password [xxxxxx]
+hwclass [tnl, nv20, nv25, r200, nv30, nv40]
```

The most interesting is probably the optional hardware class option (`+hwclass`).

`+speed` is your connection speed, 0=modem, etc.
