# Painkiller HUD pressed buttons

> This mod is made by XDavidXtreme.

This mod allows you to track pressed buttons in the game (Quake 3 Defrag-style). It is very useful for trickjump movies.

Copy the file to `..\Painkiller\Data\LScripts\Hud\`. Create folders if required.

It is recommended to enable `/speedmeter 1` via the in-game console.
