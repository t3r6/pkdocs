General Mod Overview
====================

PK++ is a modification for the game Painkiller, specifically made for
tournaments, online, and offine play. The mod consists of the follow .Pak files:

	PKPlus.pak
	PKPlusData.pak
	Fonts.pak
	Locs.pak
	Waypoints.pak
	Mapview.pak
	Hitsounds.pak

Which are to be located in your \Painkiller\Data\ directory. To start the game
with PK++ loaded, add -lscripts PKPlus.pak in the command line, such that the
game is run:

\Painkiller\Bin\Painkiller.exe -lscripts PKPlus.pak

On running the first time, your game may create some external folders. You may
edit the contents at your own risk.

NOTE: How to run with ASE, QTracker etc. :

	Edit your game executable in the application options to run 
		
	Painkiller.exe -lscripts pkplus.pak

NOTE: This mod version requires that you have the latest PK version installed.


Running Windows or Linux Dedicated Server
=========================================

Windows:

\Painkiller\Bin\Painkiller.exe -dedicated -config config.ini -lscripts PKPlus.pak

Linux:

Rename the PKPlus.pak to LScripts.pak replacing the original one. Run in the 
usual way. The 1.62 PK Linux server is not accepting command lines parameters due
to PCF's oversight, so renaming of PKPlus.pak to LScripts.pak is required.

Steamfish Updater
=================

For Windows client and server versions of the mod, an automatic update utility
has been provided to ensure that you have the latest version of the mod. You can
find this utility in \Painkiller\Data\Updater.exe This will update your mod to
the latest version.

NOTE: Do not run this utility while Painkiller is running, or the update will
not be successful.
