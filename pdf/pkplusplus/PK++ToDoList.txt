Known PCF/Game Core Bugs
========================

BUG: Stakes still fire off spawn
BUG: Linux dedicated has issues with finding maps
BUG: Next weapon does not queue properly (example: fire rocket, hit stake bind, hit sg bind, both before rocket reload is done. Next weapon is stake, not sg)
BUG: Demo playback does not interpolate players' movements.
BUG: Two different sounds still play when weapon switching + firing.
BUG: Gold Armor invisible. At times the Gold Armor is invisible for a certain player. Sometimes other items on a map are invisiable to a single player - mostly happens on absinthe
BUG: Delay with changing/firing weapons. Sometimes it will take a long time for e.g. the Rocket Launcher to fire after you just switched to it from e.g. the shotgun. Happens to all weapons I believe.
BUG: Directional rocket splash. Rockets fired in front of you will not slow you down, but speed you up. Happens both when the opponent shoots a rocket to your feet and when you yourself shoot a rocket in front of you.
BUG: Getting stuck and receiving a lot of falling damage after coming back to the ground. When you get stuck at e.g. Silver Armor on Sacred on the broken steps you'll lose 60+ health when you hit the ground again. 
BUG: Server sometimes drops to low fps, clients on server drop also. Known since 1.4. Even seen in tournament final in Turkey.
BUG: Listen server/Dedicated server sometimes start in slowmotion mode, only a restart fixes it.
BUG: Occasionally one client will connect to a server and move in slowmotion.
BUG: Linux server doesn't support commandline options
BUG: Grenades fire off-target when moving
BUG: Stakenades go through walls
BUG: Console key does not work in menu on some regional Windows versions

Spectator
=========

 ADD: Loc's for all maps
 ADD: Stats overlay

Sounds
======

 ADD: Low ammo sounds
 ADD: Painkiller frag sound
 ADD: Vote sounds
 FIX: PCF's missing game sounds bug
 BUG: Two different sounds still play when weapon switching + firing. - Will look at.
 ADD: Friendly fire hit
 ADD: Make a hitsound for freezer for BOTH sides so you know if you hit someone and they know if they've been hit.

Game/Gameplay
=============

 BUG: Stakes still fire off spawn - Probably requires PCF fix, will look at
 CHANGE: ProPlus Give SG a fixed spread (like in CPMA) - awaiting player feedback
 ADD: MD5 cdkey hash communicated to server for GUIDS
 ADD: Clan Arena
 ADD: BOOH weapons to Voosh

Other
=====

 ADD: Autodownload PK++ / Maps
 ADD: New maps for CA, TDM
 FIX: Low fps bug - Missile Controller Code?
 BUG: Delay with changing/firing weapons. - I believe this is intentional
 BUG: Shotgun secondary fire (Freezer) does NOT work. - Does anyone actually use this weapon? Perhaps in ProPlus it should inflict damage?
 BUG: Getting stuck - Physics bug, requires PCF fix unless I just remove ALL falling damage :/
