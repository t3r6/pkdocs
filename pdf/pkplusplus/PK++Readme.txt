General Mod Overview
====================

PK++ is a modification for the game Painkiller, specifically made for
tournaments, online, and offine play. The mod consists of the follow .Pak files:

	PKPlus.pak
	PKPlusData.pak
	Fonts.pak
	Locs.pak
	Waypoints.pak
	Mapview.pak
	Hitsounds.pak

Which are to be located in your \Painkiller\Data\ directory. To start the game
with PK++ loaded, add -lscripts PKPlus.pak in the command line, such that the
game is run:

\Painkiller\Bin\Painkiller.exe -lscripts PKPlus.pak

On running the first time, your game may create some external folders. You may
edit the contents at your own risk.

NOTE: How to run with ASE, QTracker etc. :

	Edit your game executable in the application options to run 
		
	Painkiller.exe -lscripts pkplus.pak

NOTE: This mod requires that you have the latest PK version installed.


Running Windows or Linux Dedicated Server
=========================================

Windows:

\Painkiller\Bin\Painkiller.exe -dedicated -config config.ini -lscripts PKPlus.pak

Linux:

Rename the PKPlus.pak to LScripts.pak replacing the original one. Run in the 
usual way. The 1.62 PK Linux server is not accepting command lines parameters due
to PCF's oversight, so renaming of PKPlus.pak to LScripts.pak is required.

The following descriptions give information on all available commands (and their
options) for PK++ for Painkiller for both clients and the server console.

=============
PK++ Features
=============

Some features requires PK++ to be installed on server. NOTE: It will take up to 20 seconds for you to auth with a PK++ server, be patient! Once authed you will recieve stats and info in spec HUD.

These features include rcon, referee, stats, spectator hud information.

================
Rcon and Referee
================

Rcon allows a client to type directly into the server console. This only happens if a rconpassword is set on the server, AND if the client's rconpassword matches the server's.

To set an rcon password, edit the config.ini file and type in Cfg.RconPass = "", if this is left blank (i.e. = ""), rcon is disabled. Alternatively type \rconpass <password> directly into the server console whilst the server is running.

On the client, connect to the server, and type 

\rconpass <password>

where <password> matches the server password exactly.

Following this you can type \rcon commands. Examples of these might be

\rcon map dm_sacred
\rcon restartmap
\rcon kickid 4
\rcon quit

Obviously if you wish to change your rconpassword via rcon, you can do this also:

\rcon rconpassword <newpassword>

But you will need to set your new password on the client immediately after.


Referee works like rcon, except for two important differences. Firstly that the commands a referee uses can only be callvote-enabled commands, and secondly, a client can be made referee either by using a refereepassword, OR by being callvoted to referee status.

To set an referee password, edit the config.ini file and type in Cfg.RefPass = "", if this is left blank (i.e. = ""), referee is disabled. Alternatively type \refpass <password> directly into the server console whilst the server is running.

On the client, connect to the server, and type 

\refpass <password>

where <password> matches the server password exactly.

Alternatively, a referee status can be callvoted. For this, firstly the clientID is required. This can be found on client or server by typing the command: \players . This will return something like the following.

4 maniax
6 outs

Using these numbers, a player status can be callvoted, for example:

\callvote referee 4

Will callvote maniax to referee status.

Following this you can type \ref commands. Examples of these might be

\ref map dm_sacred
\ref restartmap

A referee password cannot be changed remotely unless the client uses rcon.

Rockets and Rocket Jumping in ProPlus
=====================================

TO NOTE: Rocket jumping, rocket behaviour, movement and other core gameplay features have not been touched outside of ProPlus mode. ProPlus constitutes a purely community-driven adaption of PK gameplay.

Firstly please read the enclosed pdf, PainkillerRockets.pdf, titled 'A Rough Guide to Rocket Behaviour in Painkiller'. If you have questions, or wish to know more information other than that documented here, contact mods@pkeuro.com

In this document, the reasons and details of what was changed and why is discussed. It is clear that both 1.5 and 1.62 are against the design intents or ideals of PCF in this respect. And after a period of play-testing, it is clear the changes are detrimental to the game[1].

The solution proposed for play-testing in ProPlus is to adjust the rocket blast based on rocket direction. Intuitively this is the most sound solution. Even though the defaults were selected after a large amount of play-testing and experimentation; the same variables used to tweak the solution have been left available for further experimentation, but will be locked at some point in the near future.

Testing should be done on dedicated servers. Use of rcon to adjust values while testing is recommended. Make sure that proplus is enabled. As always, features in PK++ are open for discussion. PLEASE ENSURE YOU RETURN THE VALUES TO DEFAULTS FOR PUBLIC SERVERS - this will be locked after 0.8.1.62.

These settings are:

rocketfactor [number]			Multiplied by the vertical velocity fraction, becomes one less than base of the rocket factor used.

rocketfactororder [number]		Sets the exponent of the rocket factor used.

...and should be set, serverside.

Rocketfactor linearly affects the base of the overall factor which is related to rocket direction, whereas rocketfactororder affects the exponent and therefore order of magnitude of the overall factor; again, as related to rocket direction.

Physics for the equivalent of 1.5 rockets (for rj) would be rocketfactor 0, rocketfactororder 1

Physics for the equivalent of 1.62 rockets (for rj) would be rocketfactor 10, rocketfactororder 10 or so. This is not exactly the same, but

These indicate the two extremes of what has been done in PK.

By qualitative analogy only, 1.35 and/or the ideal is somewhere between, where the balance of sensible effects from rocket jumping and rocket fights are matched. The defaults as set as close as possible to match this.

NOTES:
------

Lowering rocketfactor will increase the amount of knockback an opponent occurs from a hit in fights.

Increasing rocketfactor and/or rocketfactororder will decrease the amount of horizontal knockback you recieve from a rocket jump.

A higher rocketfactororder will increase the rate of reduction of the amount of horizontal knockback you recieve from a rocket jump, as the rocket angle approaches vertically down.

If you adjust the values remember that what feels good is not necessarily good for gameplay and rocket fights. The temptation is always to increase both values, letting rocket jumps improve and overall rocket fight gameplay deteriorate. Rocket jumping is a skill, and values should not make it *too* easy.

NOTES ON DEFAULTS:
------------------

Selected defaults are set to:

rocketfactor 0.6
rocketfactororder 1

The low rocketfactor keeps rocket fights sensible, with players getting horizontal knockback from rockets, as well as retaining the possibility for off-the-wall pushes. The high rocketfactororder leads to less horizontal knockback in true rocket jumps.

==================
Notes on Loc Files
==================

Loc files are the means by which team player locations are generated for the
teamoverlay. A 'loc' files consists of a large array of named points. From these
named points, the current position of the player is determined. You can find
these files in \data\locs, and the defaults are stored in locs.pak, and are
named after tha map itself with extension '.loc'. You can open these using any
text editor, but you edit at your own risk.

If you wish to generate your own loc files for a new map, or one currently
unsupported by PK++, the process is simple. All that is required is to wander
around the map, typing \addloc <locationname> and the loc file will
automatically be generated and reloaded.

The recommended approach is firstly to place location points at the main
locations on the map. Following this more points should be added when incorrect
location names are found. Intuitively, you should add these points in the centre
of the misnamed section.

Finally you will find it useful to walk along the walls finding misnamed points
until finally all possible locations are named correctly.

Remember: Less is more. The fewer points you use to define the map the better,
since it will require less processing.

If you generate loc files and are pleased with the results, please consider
contributing them to the PK++ project by emailing them to mods@pkeuro.com

===========================
Notes on Bot Waypoint Files
===========================

Bot waypoint files are to be found in \data\waypoints, and determine how the
bots understand to move around the map. A waypoint file consists of an array of
points (which in the waypoint files are named using the loc-file location.

Waypoint files heavily affect how well the bot plays, and the defaults supplied
with PK++ can always be improved on.

If you wish to add waypoints yourself to the map, to 'teach' the bot to play and
experiment yourself, the process is relatively straightforward, although you may
wish to try a few times before to see what works and what doesn't.

Firstly start by removing (if it exists), the waypoint file for the map you wish
to regenerate. You will find these in \data\waypoints, with file extension
'.bwp'.

Next start PK++ in tdm mode, add a bot using '\addbot' ensuring \maxplayers is 2
or greater and \botminplayers is 1. After your bot has joined, join the same
team as it.

Now find your bot on the map, once you have located him, you can add the first
waypoint using the \addwaypoint command. You will see the bot come towards you
and stand at the point you just created. By adding more points you will guide
the routes available ot the bot.

Observe the following, that:

1. If a large number of points are used in a given area, the bot will spend a
long time in that area, and its movement may be erratic as it moves between
them.

2. For a detailed 'run' between two points, more points should be used in a
line. By using these you will find you can make the bot do a large number of
difficult manovers.

3. Less is more, the fewer total points which are used, the less processing PK
requires.

4. The bot will ignore waypoints it can see when their evelation is much higher
than the bot. If you wish, for instance to guide a bot up stairs, you will
require some points midway up.

5. Waypoints should be included towards and on top of key items.

Notes on Mapview Files
======================

Mapview files are to be found in \data\mapview and consist of an overhead map
image, and a config file which scales/aligns the image to the screen, and
scales/aligns the players to the image.

If you wish to add your own mapviews, or adjust the position and scale of the
mapview, you may do so.

Notes on creating new mapview images
------------------------------------

Mapview images are created using Painkiller's Editor. Start the editor and load
the map, then press 'f' to enter fly mode. Move yourself using the W,A,S,D keys
to a long way above the map. If you find the map vanishes or goes misty increase
the FarClipDist under properties on the right panel, and/or set Fog to No Fog.

Once you are a long way above the map, set the FOV to 10 to remove perspective
effects. You may find with this new FOV you need to move even higher above the
map.

Once you have a complete view of the map, hit F10 which will put you in
fullscreen mode, then F12 to take a screenshot. The final required resolution is
320x240, but it is highly recommended that you take the screenshot at 800x600 or
more.

Once you have a good screenshot, open it up in a picture editor; Adobe Photoshop
is recommended, and is the example used here.

Crop the image as required, and resize to 320x240, Save As .tga into
\data\mapview\ with the file name the same as the required map name.

Next you will need to create an alpha channel for the map. The alpha channel is
a black and white (technically greycsale) image which masks out transparency
within PK.

When you have the map image open in Photoshop, enable viewing of the channels
from Window->Channels.

If the alpha channel does not exist you will need to create it, you can do so
using the small icon at the bottom of the Channels panel. Within the Channels
panel you should now see RGB, R, G, B, and Alpha 1 channels. The default Alpha
channel is just a plain black image.

Next is to construct the alpha mask from a greyscale copy of the map itself. To
do this make a copy of the map image using Image->Duplicate.

Firstly if your background from your screenshot is the default blue used in the
editor, you can replace the colour using Photoshop's replace colour option. You
can find this in Image->Adjustments->Replace Colour.. select the colour and
replace with black.

Ensuring you are working on your duplicate image, turn it into greyscale mode..
Image->Mode->Greyscale.

You wish to have the areas you wish to see on the screen completely white.
However, you will find from direct greyscale conversion, you will have a large
number of grey artifacts. You can remove these by adjusting the contrast of the
image. Image->Adjustments->Brightness and Contrast, and set the Contrast slider
between +50 and +100. This will remove the majority of the grey in the map area.
Select a brush, with ink set to white to remove the rest by hand. Additionally
you can apply some blurring to the edges to soften the transparency edges.

When completed, copy and paste the greyscale mask into the alpha channel of your
original image. Save changes.

You may need to rotate the image using Photoshop, but you will not be able to
determine this until you've loaded it into PK.

Notes on Config Files
---------------------

Start by making a copy of an existing .cfg file and rename to match the map name
for which you are making a mapview. This will fix the screen location and image
scale (the tool previously used for this in-game was removed from the release
version since it was considered obfuscate the process, and allow too many
configuration errors).

The config format is in the form:

<globalscale>,<globaltranslatex>,<globaltranslatey>,<globaltranslaterot>,<imagescale>,<imagetranslatex>,<imagetranslatey>

In the above list, the prefix of 'global' refers to mapping the player coordinates onto the screen. 
globaltranslaterot is however, currently disabled.

The prefix 'image' refers purely to the mapview image and where it is located on the screen.

In your config for Painkiller, in \Painkiller\Bin\config.ini, set the values:

	Cfg.ConfigMapView = true,
	Cfg.MapView = true,
	Cfg.MapViewShowRespawns = true,

Respawns are used to quickly align player positions to images, although you can
rely on player locations alone.

Spectate a game, probably a bot game is easiest, and ensure mapview is on.

Weapon keys 1-6 will you to configure the player positions, and configs are
saved in real time. Weapon keys 1-2 are to scale the player positions. 3-4 and
5-6 are for horizontal and verical translations.

Use these keys to position the respawns to your image. If your image is
incorrect and needs rotation you may need to do this.

contributing them to the PK++ project by emailing them to mods@pkeuro.com
