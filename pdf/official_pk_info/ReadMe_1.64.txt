====================================================================
1. Introduction 
====================================================================

Painkiller is an action-driven FPS (first person shooter) game set in a 
dark and sinister world somewhere between heaven and hell.  You take on 
the role of Daniel Garner, a seemingly regular guy, who has just been
killed in a horrific car accident.  As you struggle to find the reasons
why you've been denied entrance into heaven, you must fight against hordes
of demonic soldiers in an attempt to stop an imminent holy war.


Continuing with the Painkiller Expansion, Battle Out of Hell, Daniel 
Garner is surrounded by dozens of hell's minions and the unconscious 
Eve lying at his feet.  Alastor, once servant of the Dark Lord himself, 
is vying to become ruler of all the netherworld and re-launch the 
failed assault on Heaven.  You alone stand on the brink of two fates - 
ultimate glory or total destruction.

This update features the latest version of the PAIN Engine (1.64) along
with a myriad of enhancements and fixes.



To Play the Game:

1) Launch the Painkiller shortcut.

2) From the Main Menu select Sign the Pact.

3) Choose which version you would like to play.

4) Select your difficulty level.

5) Watch the intro video and then select Chapter 1, Level 1 in the
map tool, by clicking on the crimson crystal.

You can also adjust various settings like controls, video settings, and 
game options of the Main Menu under the Options selection.

====================================================================
3. DirectX 9 and Drivers
====================================================================

Painkiller Black Edition has been tested with a variety of video 
and sound cards.  Please ensure all drivers are up to date for the 
system hardware, especially for video cards.


The latest drivers for NVIDIA based cards can be found here:

http://www.nvidia.com/content/drivers/drivers.asp


The latest drivers for ATI based cards can be found here:

http://www.ati.com/support/driver.html


If you have a VIA chipset in your PC, please make sure you are using 
the latest VIA drivers – found at: 

http://www.viavpsd.com/download/index.jsp


Painkiller also requires the installation of DirectX 9.0c. If you 
don't have the latest version of DirectX, please download the 
installer from:
 
http://www.microsoft.com/windows/directx/downloads/default.asp


====================================================================
4. Performance and Configuring
====================================================================

Painkiller Black Edition requires both good CPU and Graphics 
processing power for an optimum playing experience.  If you find your 
framerate to be too low, please adjust your video settings under the 
Options Menu.  Dropping texture quality levels for the game architecture, 
sky, characters, and weapons to lower levels, as well as the overall 
graphics resolution will help achieve improved game performance.  Most 
importantly, make sure Dynamic Lights, Character Shadows and Water FX 
settings are adjusted accordingly - set them to normal or low to 
dramatically improve the game performance.  Dynamic Lights and Character 
Shadows are primarily recommended for high end DirectX 9 cards like the 
GeForce 6800 and Radeon X800.

For multiplayer gaming please make sure to set your Connection Speed
accurately under Player Settings in the Multiplayer Menu.  Please also
see the multiplayer specific tuning suggestions contained in Section 5, 
'Additional Information' below.

Also for multiplayer play on the Internet behind a firewall and/or proxy 
server please make sure to have the required port open to connect.  
Painkiller by default uses port 3455 (UDP).  Painkiller will not connect 
without an open port.

Note GameSpy Arcade utilizes additional ports.  A list of those ports and
other support for GameSpy Arcade can be found here:

http://www.gamespyarcade.com/support/firewalls.shtml
  

====================================================================
5. Additional Information
====================================================================

Information on some of the following topics has not been included or has 
changed since the printing of early versions of the manual.  Note: the
full manual for the game is available on disc and in the shortcuts menu
for Painkiller Black Edition.  Adobe Acrobat Reader is required to
view this manual.  It is freely available at:

http://www.adobe.com/products/acrobat/readermain.html


- Text clarifying the additional sniping, zoom mode for the Boltgun/Heater
is missing in some versions of the manual.  It is as follows, "Be sure to 
try-out the scoped, sniping mode (default control is the Middle Mouse 
Button) for extreme distant shots."

- There is an error in the credits included in some printings of the 
Black Edition manual.  The DreamCatcher credit for Assistant Engineer
should read, "Joe Moeller."

	1) setmaxfps
	2) serverframerate
	3) enemyinterpolation

Values given below are suggested values only. You may find you need 
different settings for varying number of players on the server (Duel or 
Free For All game modes as an example).

--------------------------
setmaxfps 60, 30 or less*.
serverframerate 15 or less.
enemyinterpolation 1

*If the framerate becomes too low for you to play, it is recommended 
that you pick a reasonable framerate, and limit your upstream

and 'setmaxfps 60'.
