====================================================================
1. Introduction 
====================================================================

Painkiller is an action-driven FPS (first person shooter) game set in a 
dark and sinister world somewhere between heaven and hell.  You take on 
the role of Daniel Garner, a seemingly regular guy, who has just been
killed in a horrific car accident.  As you struggle to find the reasons
why you've been denied entrance into heaven, you must fight against hordes
of demonic soldiers in an attempt to stop an imminent holy war.

To Play the Game:

1) Launch the Painkiller shortcut.

2) From the Main Menu select Sign the Pact.

3) Select your difficulty level.

4) Watch the intro video and then select Chapter 1, Level 1 in the
map tool, by clicking on the crimson crystal.

You can also adjust various settings like controls, video settings, and 
game options of the Main Menu under the Options selection.


====================================================================

	Video: 128 MB DirectX 9 card, NVIDIA GeForce FX 5700 or better
	Sound: DirectX 8.1b or better compatible
	Input: Keyboard and mouse


====================================================================
3. DirectX 9 and Drivers
====================================================================

Painkiller has been tested with a variety of video and sound cards.
Please ensure all drivers are up to date for the system hardware, 
especially for video cards.


The latest drivers for NVIDIA based cards can be found here:

http://www.nvidia.com/content/drivers/drivers.asp


The latest drivers for ATI based cards can be found here:

http://www.ati.com/support/driver.html


If you have a VIA chipset in your PC, please make sure you are using 
the latest VIA drivers – found at: 

http://www.viavpsd.com/download/index.jsp


Painkiller also requires the installation of DirectX 9.0b. If you don't 
have the latest version of DirectX, please download the installer 
from:

http://www.microsoft.com/windows/directx/downloads/default.asp  


====================================================================
4. Performance and Configuring
====================================================================

Painkiller requires both good CPU and Graphics processing power for an
optimum playing experience.  If you find your framerate to be too low, 
please adjust your video settings under the Options Menu.  Dropping texture 
quality levels for the game architecture, sky, characters, and weapons to
lower levels, as well as the overall graphics resolution will help achieve 
improved game performance.

For multiplayer gaming please make sure to set your Connection Speed
accurately under Player Settings in the Multiplayer Menu.

Also for multiplayer play on the Internet behind a firewall and/or proxy 
server please make sure to have the required port open to connect.  
Painkiller by default uses port 3455.  Painkiller will not connect without
an open port.

Note GameSpy Arcade utilizes additional ports.  A list of those ports and
other support for GameSpy Arcade can be found here:

http://www.gamespyarcade.com/support/firewalls.shtml
  

====================================================================
5. Additional Information
====================================================================

Information on some of the following topics has not been included or has 
changed since the printing of early versions of the manual:

- Start-up CD: You must have CD 3 in your CD/DVD-ROM drive to start
Painkiller.

- Locked Difficulty Modes: Trauma mode is available after collecting 23 
cards, not Nightmare mode.

- Checkpoints: Save checkpoints on both Daydream and Insomnia modes 
replenish your health fully.

- Quicksaves:  Quicksaves are available in Painkiller.  They default to keys
F5 (save) and F9 (load).

- Headbob:  The option to control the amount of walking and head motion
you see while playing has been included in the HUD settings under the
Options Menu.  Lowering this setting will make less motion.

- Clip Plane:  An option to control the far viewing distance in the game 
world has been included under the Advanced Video tab in the Options Menu.
By lowering this setting you may have improved performance but you will
not be able to see as far into the game world.

- Audio Settings:  On certain configurations it has been noted that 
selecting the "Miles Fast 2D Positional Audio" driver as the Sound 
setting under the Options Menu will prove to be more stable than other 
hardware drivers.

- Low-end cards:  While Painkiller supports most older video cards 
(see System Requirements above), some of Painkiller's special effects 
and advanced graphics features are not supported by these boards.  While 
this will not affect game play in any way, some visual effects may be 
reduced or disabled entirely on lower end video cards.

- Dedicated Servers:    A short-cut to run a multiplayer dedicated server
is provided in the Start Menu folder for Painkiller after installation.  
Dedicated servers generally have better performance and are preferred for 
Internet play.  The same system requirements apply for dedicated servers.

DEMO RECORDING Usage:
-----------------------------
Only clients should record the demo. Server can also record, but the 
recording starts only when any client connects.

- Recording the demo:
a) you need to schedule the recording *before* connecting to the server.
b) in the game menu, type in: DEMORECORD [name], for example: DEMORECORD TEST

- Finishing the recording:
a) you can stop the recording either by disconnecting from the server, or 
   by typing in: DEMOSTOP

- Playing the demo:
a) to play the demo type in: DEMOPLAY [name], eg. DEMOPLAY [test]
b) you can use grey +/- keys to speed up/slow down the demo playback

NOTE: Demos have .pkd extension. You don't need to add this extension when 
      playing or recording the demo (eg. you should type in DEMORECORD TEST 
      instead of DEMORECORD TEST.PKD)


WARMUP SYSTEM Usage:
-----------------------------

There is a new warm-up system for Team Deathmatch and People Can Fly modes. In 
warm-up the game doesn't start until all players are ready, but to kill the 
boredom of waiting for this last one player everyone can move around/fire etc.

To start the game you can either type in: READY (type NOTREADY to unready 
yourself) or press TAB once. Normally pressing TAB (default) during the game 
shows you the scoreboard as long as you keep TAB depressed. In warm-up, 
pressing TAB shows the players list and you can ready/unready/switch teams. 
Press TAB again to hide the scoreboard.

Note that you can kickban the players who deliberately block you from starting 
the game. You can also break the match at any time by typing in BREAK command. 

Console commands are available below and online at painkillergame.com.


SPECTATOR MODE Usage:
-----------------------------

You can spectate the games. To do that, click one on the server you want to 
join and select SPECTATE instead of JOIN. Alternatively, you can use console 
commands like SPECTATOR 1/0 and JOIN command. 

Console commands are available below and online at painkillergame.com.

When spectating, you can switch between 3 different views:
a) FPS - where you can see the game from the eyes of a given player (note you 
   don't see the player's weapon in this mode);
b) TPP - Third Person Perspective, where you can see a given player from bird's 
   eye view
c) Free - where you can freely move anywhere on the level

You can switch between players at any time.


VOTING SYSTEM Usage:
-----------------------------

Now the players can change the map, game mode, and much more. For example:
a) if you want to change the map to DM_SACRED, type in: CALLVOTE MAP DM_SACRED
b) other players need to type in: VOTE YES if they agree to change the map
c) if less than 50% of the players votes in favor (incl. you) in 30 sec time 
   period, voting will finish with no success
d) ...but if more than 50% of the players execute VOTE YES, the map will be 
   changed to DM_SACRED

Console commands are available below and online at painkillergame.com.


BENCHMARKING TOOL Usage:
------------------------------

You can benchmark your system by running fly-by demo. When in the menu, type 
in: BENCHMARK C5L1 or BENCHMARK C5L2. At the end of the test you will see the 
average fps, final score etc.  Level C5L2 (Docks) is more representative of
actual Painkiller game play (intensive explosions, Havok physics, lighting,
Demon morphing FX, etc.) than C5L1.  On either benchmark be sure to run 
multiple passes to obtain a valid average score.


SERVER START and CONFIG FILE Usage:
------------------------------------

You can start Painkiller servers now with more options via the command line
and configuration files.  The following start-up parameters can be used:

To automatically start a dedicated server with settings from a given
configuration file (in this example it is 'config.ini'):

painkiller.exe -dedicated -start -cfg config.ini 

To automatically start a dedicated server where all settings and changes 
from a given configuration are written to a file (in this example it is 
'newconfig.ini'):

painkiller.exe -cfg newconfig.ini


PREDICTION CODE:
------------------------------

In addition to general networking improvements, the Painkiller 1.3 update has
reworked, improved forward-looking prediction code implemented.  This code 
should be helpful to players with higher pings.  In addition a client's FPS
is not limited by a dedicated server's FPS setting.  Prediction is also now 
automatically on and no longer needs to use the checkbox and/or console
commands introduced in older versions of the game.


ADMIN SETTINGS:
---------------

When running dedicated server, admins have the option to disallow players
to change some game settings. Click on VOTING tab to check/uncheck these game
settings you want to allow/disallow for CALLVOTE change.
