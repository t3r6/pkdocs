1. Introduction 
====================================================================

Painkiller is an action-driven FPS (first person shooter) game set in a 
dark and sinister world somewhere between heaven and hell.  You take on 
the role of Daniel Garner, a seemingly regular guy, who has just been
killed in a horrific car accident.  As you struggle to find the reasons
why you've been denied entrance into heaven, you must fight against hordes
of demonic soldiers in an attempt to stop an imminent holy war.

To Play the Game:

1) Launch the Painkiller shortcut.

2) From the Main Menu select Sign the Pact.

3) Select your difficulty level.

4) Watch the intro video and then select Chapter 1, Level 1 in the
map tool, by clicking on the crimson crystal.

You can also adjust various settings like controls, video settings, and 
game options of the Main Menu under the Options selection.

3. DirectX 9 and Drivers
====================================================================

Painkiller has been tested with a variety of video and sound cards.
Please ensure all drivers are up to date for the system hardware, 
especially for video cards.


The latest drivers for NVIDIA based cards can be found here:

http://www.nvidia.com/content/drivers/drivers.asp


The latest drivers for ATI based cards can be found here:

http://www.ati.com/support/driver.html


If you have a VIA chipset in your PC, please make sure you are using 
the latest VIA drivers – found at: 

http://www.viavpsd.com/download/index.jsp


Painkiller also requires the installation of DirectX 9.0b. If you don't 
have the latest version of DirectX, please download the installer 
from:

http://www.microsoft.com/windows/directx/downloads/default.asp  


====================================================================
4. Performance and Configuring
====================================================================

Painkiller requires both good CPU and Graphics processing power for an
optimum playing experience.  If you find your framerate to be too low, 
please adjust your video settings under the Options Menu.  Dropping texture 
quality levels for the game architecture, sky, characters, and weapons to
lower levels, as well as the overall graphics resolution will help achieve 
improved game performance.

For multiplayer gaming please make sure to set your Connection Speed
accurately under Player Settings in the Multiplayer Menu.

Also for multiplayer play on the Internet behind a firewall and/or proxy 
server please make sure to have the required port open to connect.  
Painkiller by default uses port 3455.  Painkiller will not connect without
an open port.

Note GameSpy Arcade utilizes additional ports.  A list of those ports and
other support for GameSpy Arcade can be found here:

====================================================================
5. Additional Information
====================================================================

Information on some of the following topics has not been included or has 
changed since the printing of the manual:

- Checkpoints: Save checkpoints on both Daydream and Insomnia modes 
replenish your health fully.

- Quicksaves:  Quicksaves are available in Painkiller.  They default to keys
F5 (save) and F9 (load).

- Headbob:  The option to control the amount of walking and head motion
you see while playing has been included in the HUD settings under the
Options Menu.  Lowering this setting will make less motion.

- Clip Plane:  An option to control the far viewing distance in the game 
world has been included under the Advanced Video tab in the Options Menu.
By lowering this setting you may have improved performance but you will
not be able to see as far into the game world.

- Audio Settings:  On certain configurations it has been noted that 
selecting the "Miles Fast 2D Positional Audio" driver as the Sound 
setting under the Options Menu will prove to be more stable than other 
hardware drivers.

- Low-end cards:  While Painkiller supports most older video cards 
(see System Requirements above), some of Painkiller's special effects 
and advanced graphics features are not supported by these boards.  While 
this will not affect game play in any way, some visual effects may be 
reduced or disabled entirely on lower end video cards.

- Dedicated Servers:    A short-cut to run a multiplayer dedicated server
is provided in the Start Menu folder for Painkiller after installation.  
Dedicated servers generally have better performance and are preferred for 
Internet play.  The same system requirements apply for dedicated servers.
