====================================================================
1. Introduction 
====================================================================

Painkiller is an action-driven FPS (first person shooter) game set in a 
dark and sinister world somewhere between heaven and hell.  You take on 
the role of Daniel Garner, a seemingly regular guy, who has just been
killed in a horrific car accident.  As you struggle to find the reasons
why you've been denied entrance into heaven, you must fight against hordes
of demonic soldiers in an attempt to stop an imminent holy war.

Continuing with the Painkiller Expansion, Battle Out of Hell, Daniel 
Garner is surrounded by dozens of hell's minions and the unconscious 
Eve lying at his feet.  Alastor, once servant of the Dark Lord himself, 
is vying to become ruler of all the netherworld and re-launch the 
failed assault on Heaven.  You alone stand on the brink of two fates - 
ultimate glory or total destruction.

This update features the latest version of the PAIN Engine (1.61) along
with a myriad of enhancements and fixes. 

To Play the Game:

1) Launch the Painkiller shortcut.

2) From the Main Menu select Sign the Pact.

3) Select Painkiller or Battle Out of Hell.

4) Select your difficulty level.

5) Watch the intro video and then select Chapter 1, Level 1 in the
map tool, by clicking on the crimson crystal.

You can also adjust various settings like controls, video settings, and 
game options of the Main Menu under the Options selection.

====================================================================
3. DirectX 9 and Drivers
====================================================================

Painkiller and Battle Out of Hell have been tested with a variety of 
video and sound cards.  Please ensure all drivers are up to date for 
the system hardware, especially for video cards.


The latest drivers for NVIDIA based cards can be found here:

http://www.nvidia.com/content/drivers/drivers.asp


The latest drivers for ATI based cards can be found here:

http://www.ati.com/support/driver.html


If you have a VIA chipset in your PC, please make sure you are using 
the latest VIA drivers – found at: 

http://www.viavpsd.com/download/index.jsp


Painkiller also requires the installation of DirectX 9.0c. If you 
don't have the latest version of DirectX, please download the 
installer from:
 
http://www.microsoft.com/windows/directx/downloads/default.asp


====================================================================
4. Performance and Configuring
====================================================================

Painkiller and Painkiller Battle Out of Hell requires both good CPU 
and Graphics processing power for an optimum playing experience.  If 
you find your framerate to be too low, please adjust your video settings 
under the Options Menu.  Dropping texture quality levels for the game 
architecture, sky, characters, and weapons to lower levels, as well 
as the overall graphics resolution will help achieve improved game 
performance.  Most importantly, make sure Dynamic Lights, Character 
Shadows and Water FX settings are adjusted accordingly - set them to 
normal or low to dramatically improve the game performance.  Dynamic 
Lights and Character Shadows are primarily recommended for high end 
DirectX 9 cards like the GeForce 6800 and Radeon X800.

For multiplayer gaming please make sure to set your Connection Speed
accurately under Player Settings in the Multiplayer Menu.  Please also
see the multiplayer specific tuning suggestions contained in Section 5, 
'Additional Information' below.

Also for multiplayer play on the Internet behind a firewall and/or proxy 
server please make sure to have the required port open to connect.  
Painkiller by default uses port 3455 (UDP).  Painkiller will not connect 
without an open port.

Note GameSpy Arcade utilizes additional ports.  A list of those ports and
other support for GameSpy Arcade can be found here:

====================================================================
5. Additional Information
====================================================================

Information on some of the following topics has not been included or has 
changed since the printing of early versions of the Painkiller manual:

- Start-up CD: You must have CD 1 in your CD/DVD-ROM drive to start
Painkiller.

- Locked Difficulty Modes: Trauma mode is available after collecting 23 
cards, not Nightmare mode.

- Checkpoints: Save checkpoints on both Daydream and Insomnia modes 
replenish your health fully.

- Quicksaves:  Quicksaves are available in Painkiller.  They default to keys
F5 (save) and F9 (load).

- Headbob:  The option to control the amount of walking and head motion
you see while playing has been included in the HUD settings under the
Options Menu.  Lowering this setting will make less motion.

- Clip Plane:  An option to control the far viewing distance in the game 
world has been included under the Advanced Video tab in the Options Menu.
By lowering this setting you may have improved performance but you will
not be able to see as far into the game world.

- Audio Settings:  On certain configurations it has been noted that 
selecting the "Miles Fast 2D Positional Audio" driver as the Sound 
setting under the Options Menu will prove to be more stable than other 
hardware drivers.

- Low-end cards:  While Painkiller supports most older video cards 
(see System Requirements above), some of Painkiller's special effects 
and advanced graphics features are not supported by these boards.  While 
this will not affect game play in any way, some visual effects may be 
reduced or disabled entirely on lower end video cards.

- Dedicated Servers:    A short-cut to run a multiplayer dedicated server
is provided in the Start Menu folder for Painkiller after installation.  
Dedicated servers generally have better performance and are preferred for 
Internet play.  The same system requirements apply for dedicated servers.


Information on some of the following topics has not been included or has 
changed since the printing of early versions of the Battle Out of Hell 
manual:

- Text clarifying the additional sniping, zoom mode for the Boltgun/Heater
is missing in some versions of the manual.  It is as follows, "Be sure to 
try-out the scoped, sniping mode (default control is the Middle Mouse 
Button) for extreme distant shots."

- There is a pagination fault on page 12.  The description of the Evil
Girl continues on the following page.

- On page 27, the term FPS near the top of the page should be 'FPP', as in
First Person Perspective.

- There is an error in the credits included in some printings of the 
Battle Out of Hell manual.  The DreamCatcher credit for Assistant Engineer
should read, "Joe Moeller."

Although you will generally find that you can play just fine with the

and improve your performance.  The key commands are:

	1) setmaxfps
	2) serverframerate
	3) enemyinterpolation

different settings for varying number of players on the server (Duel or 
Free For All game modes as an example).

For MODEMs (56kbps minimum)
--------------------------
setmaxfps 60, 30 or less*.
serverframerate 15 or less.
enemyinterpolation 1

*If the framerate becomes too low for you to play, it is recommended 
that you pick a reasonable framerate, and limit your upstream 
using the 'clientbandwidth' command. Try 'clientbandwidth 2000' 
and 'setmaxfps 60'.
